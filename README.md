**./Automatic Evaluation Outputs**

Outputs of the systems for the 91 transformed sentences automatically evaluated. These are the first 70 sentences of the test corpus of HSplit (Sulem et al., 2016).
The source and reference sentences as well as the outputs for HSplit can be found at https://github.com/feralvam/easse/tree/master/easse/resources/data/test_sets/hsplit.
The outputs for HYBRID (Narayan and Gardent, 2014) can be found at https://github.com/XingxingZhang/dress.
