# Semantic-based Text Simplification

Handcrafted rules and Automatic Evaluation results for a Semantic-based Text Simplification system from the paper:

```
GRASS: A Syntactic Text Simplification System using DMRS Semantic Representations 
Rita Hijazi, Bernard Espinasse, NÃºria Gala
```
**./Automatic Evaluation Outputs**

Outputs of the systems for the 91 transformed sentences automatically evaluated from the test corpus of Hsplit ([repo](https://github.com/eliorsulem/HSplit-corpus) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05022.pdf)).

The source, the reference sentences as well as the outputs for HSplit and the evaluated systems outputs can be found at
