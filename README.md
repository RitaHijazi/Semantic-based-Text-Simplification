# Semantic-based Text Simplification

Handcrafted rules and Automatic Evaluation results for a Semantic-based Text Simplification system from the paper:

```
GRASS: A Syntactic Text Simplification System using DMRS Semantic Representations

```
**./Automatic Evaluation Outputs**

Outputs of the systems for the 91 transformed sentences automatically evaluated from the test corpus of HSplit (Sulem et al., 2016). 

The source, the reference sentences as well as the outputs for HSplit and the evaluated systems outputs can be found at
